# Systematic Progress & Checkpoint Guard

## Core Principle

NEVER binge-code. Implement in very small, atomic steps to ensure accuracy and alignment with the user's vision.

## Rules

8. **Design Consistency**: Maintain the "Wow" factor using:
   - **Colors**: Primary `oklch(0.205 0 0)` to `blue-400` gradients.
   - **Effects**: Glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur-sm`), subtle border glints (`border-primary/20`), and floating background blobs.
   - **Animations**: Soft `y` offsets on hover, staggering for lists, and `AnimatePresence` for transitions.
